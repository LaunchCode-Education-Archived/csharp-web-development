Exercises: Classes and Objects
==============================

Before you get started, make sure you have forked and cloned the `starter code <https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/csharp-web-dev-lsn3and4classes>`_.

#. Open up the file, ``Student.cs``, and update the starter code to make use of auto-implemented properties.
#. In ``Program.cs``, instantiate the ``Student`` class using yourself as the student. For the
   ``NumberOfCredits`` give yourself ``1`` for this class and a GPA of ``4.0``
   because you are a C# superstar!
#. In the ``SchoolPractice`` project, create a class ``Course`` with at least three
   fields. Before diving into Visual Studio, try using pen and paper to work through
   what these might be. At least one of your fields should be a ``List``
   or ``Dictionary``, and you should use your ``Student`` class.
#. Using auto-implemented properties, in the ``SchoolPractice`` project, create a class ``Teacher`` with four properties:
   ``FirstName``, ``LastName``, ``Subject``, and ``YearsTeaching``.
