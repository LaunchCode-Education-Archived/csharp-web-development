C# Naming Conventions
=====================

C# has some very straightforward `naming conventions <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions#naming-conventions>`__. These are
universally used by C# programmers, and differ in some cases from
conventions commonly used in Python or other coding languages.

Again, these are conventions. Not following them will not prevent your
code from running, as long as you are following `C#'s naming
rules <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/identifier-names>`__.
