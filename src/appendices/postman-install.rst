Installing Postman
==================

When exploring and testing a web API, it is invaluable to have an interactive environment that allows you to fine-tune requests. For example, you may need 
to configure the HTTP method, headers, or body of the request -- all of which the browser does not allow you to do. Instead of testing in a browser, 
we can use tools made specifically for interacting with APIs. One of the most popular API tools in the industry is **Postman**. Postman is a cross-platform 
tool that puts you in full control of configuring and executing API requests. 

Installing Postman is easy thanks to its cross-platform nature. You can download the installer on `their downloads page <https://www.postman.com/downloads/>`_. 

**Windows Users**: Select the *Windows x64* installer download then run the installer:

   Windows user should select the *Windows 64-bit* download option

After installation, if Postman does not open automatically, locate the download and open it manually. Making an account can be useful, but if you do not 
want to create one, select the link in grey at the bottom of the splash screen that reads: "Skip signing in and take me straight to the to the app":
