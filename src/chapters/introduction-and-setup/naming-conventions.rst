C# Naming Conventions
=====================

C# has some very straightforward naming conventions. These are
universally used by C# programmers, and differ in some cases from
conventions commonly used in Python or other languages.

Again, these are conventions. Not following them will not prevent your
code from running, as long as you are following `C#’s naming
rules <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa664670(v=vs.71).aspx>`__.

     - Start with a lowercase letter and use camelCase
     - ``id``,  ``firstName``

   * - Methods, properties, and class names
     - Start with an uppercase letter and capitalize each word; do not use hyphens or underscores (aka PascalCase)
     - ``Program`` , ``HelloWorld``, ``TempConv``


Microsoft provides some `more detailed naming

(From the date on this article, you’ll note that these have been
relatively standard for a very long time!)
