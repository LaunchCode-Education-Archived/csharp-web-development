If It Ain't Broke, Add a Breakpoint!
====================================

On your machine, open up your fork of the ``HelloASPDotNETDemo`` `repository <https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/HelloASPDotNETDemo>`_ in Visual Studio.
The purpose of this studio is to talk about your current debugging strategies and how to make the most of the debugger tools discussed in this chapter.

Before we start practicing with debugging tools, go over with the group one error you encountered when working on your own version of ``HelloASPDotNET``.

#. What was the error?
#. How did you solve this error? What have been the strategies and tools you have been using so far to debug your code?
#. Could one of the debugging tools helped you when addressing this error?

Review the code from ``HelloASPDotNETDemo`` and use the debugging tools in Visual Studio to address potentional problems.

Questions to review as you look through the code:

#. When would you use the *Call Stack* pane? If you run the app and it is already functioning, what shows up there? 
#. What breakpoints should you add?
#. Would a conditional breakpoint make sense to use in the context of this app?

Once you have gone through the demo code, open up a piece of code you have been struggling with.
In what ways could making use of debugging tools help you figure out what is going on with the code?
