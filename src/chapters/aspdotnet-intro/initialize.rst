Create a New ASP.NET Project
============================

ASP.NET is a framework in the .NET Core family that is used to build web applications.
While `ASP.NET <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/overview>`_ can be used to build a wide variety of web applications, we will be focusing on using it to build MVC web applications.

Getting Started
---------------

To create a ASP.NET MVC project, start a new project in Visual Studio.

#. When selecting the type of project, head over to *.NET Core* and select *Web Application (model-view-controller)*.
#. Name your project *HelloDotNet* and put it in the appropriate directory for all of your classwork.
#. Once you hit *OK*, Visual Studio will create a fully-functioning web application for you.
#. Hit *Run* and take note of the port number your application opens up to.

The home page of your application is full of curated content and extra resources from Microsoft on how to use ASP.NET. Bookmark these as you see fit!

The Github repo to follow is `HelloASPDotNET <https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/HelloASPDotNET>`. After creation, the project should look like ``master``.
