Cloning a C# Project
====================

The steps here walk you through setting up a repository that you’ll
use to study example code and work on coding exercises.

#. Visit the `LaunchCodeEducation/csharp-web-dev-lsn1datatypes <https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/csharp-web-dev-lsn1datatypes>`__
   repository page and fork the repository into your own GitHub account by
   selecting *Fork* from the top right of the page.

Windows Users
-------------

#. From within Visual Studio, choose the
   *Team Explorer* tab near the bottom of the *Solution Explorer* pane. If
   you don’t see this tab, you can open it via the application menu: *View
   > Team Explorer*. The first time you do this, you will need to click
   *Connect…* and then sign in to GitHub.

   .. admonition:: Tip

      If you are currently viewing the 
      :ref:`project opener pane <vs-windows-project-opener>`, you can
      open the editor to access the Team Explorer tab by choosing 
      "Continue without code ->".

#. Once connected, select *Clone* from the GitHub section of the *Team Explorer* and select
   your ``csharp-web-dev-lsn1datatypes`` copy from the modal window. **Be sure to
   change the Path field** to the location you would like the project to
   live, ideally inside of a folder you’ve been using to store other
   projects.

Mac Users
---------

#. With Visual Studio open, select *Version Control > Checkout* from the menu bar. 

#. This opens a window to connect to a remote repository. Copy the address for your forked exercises repository 
   and enter it into the *url* section of the form. The rest of the form fields will auto-populate:

   .. admonition:: Note

      We use SSH to clone the repo above, but you can use HTTPS if you prefer it.
      If you're not sure which you want to use, that's ok too.

#. Enter the *Target Directory* where you would like to keep your project

   .. admonition:: Tip
   
      Make this a new, empty folder inside of your designated C# practice directory.
