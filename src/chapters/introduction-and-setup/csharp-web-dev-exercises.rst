C# Web Dev Exercises
====================

Initial Setup
-------------

The steps here will walk you through setting up a repository that youâ€™ll
use to study example code, work on studios, and complete your first
assignment of this unit.

#. Create a *Fork* of `LaunchCodeEducation/csharp-web-dev-exercises <TODO: Link this repo>`__.
   Clone your fork in the csharp practice directory you made on the previous page.

#. Open Visual Studio. From the opening window, select the option to *Open a local
   Visual Studio project, solution, or file*. From here, search your computer for your cloned
   copy of ``csharp-web-dev-exercises``. When you find it, select 
   ``csharp-web-dev-exercises.sln`` to open.
