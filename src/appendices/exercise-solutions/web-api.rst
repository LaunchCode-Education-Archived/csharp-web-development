Exercise Solutions:  Web APIs and REST
======================================

This exercise was designed to promote discussion around APIs and REST.  
Each section asks about a shorthand notation.  
The notation is a simplified way to describe the API endpoints.  

Our solution below is an example of the shorthand you can create by reading through each section.
Once you have a shorthand endpoint, you should be able to answer the questions for each state.

GET a Single Coding Event
-------------------------

Using our endpoint shorthand, how would we describe this action?

.. sourcecode:: csharp

      GET /api/events -> CodingEvent[]
