C# Web Dev Exercises
====================

The steps here walk you through setting up a repository that you’ll
use to study example code, work on studios, and complete your first
assignment of this unit.

TODO: update this repo name

#. Visit the `LaunchCodeEducation/csharp-exercises <https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/csharp-exercises>`__
   repository page and fork the repository into your own GitHub account by
   selecting *Fork* from the top right of the page.

Windows Users
-------------

#. After forking, open Visual Studio. From within Visual Studio, choose the
   *Team Explorer* tab near the bottom of the *Solution Explorer* pane. If
   you don’t see this tab, you can open it via the application menu: *View
   > Team Explorer*. The first time you do this, you will need to click
   *Connect…* and then sign in to GitHub.

#. Select *Clone* from the GitHub section of the *Team Explorer* and select
   your ``csharp-exercises`` copy from the modal window. **Be sure to
   change the Path field** to the location you would like the project to
   live, ideally inside of a folder you’ve been using to store other
   projects.

Mac Users
---------

#. With Visual Studio open, select *Version Control > Checkout* from the menu bar. 

#. This opens a window to connect to a remote repository. Copy the address for your forked exercises repository 
   and enter it into the *url* section of the form. The rest of the form fields will auto-populate:

   .. figure:: ./figures/vsmac-checkout-github.png
      :alt: Visual Studio for Mac checkout Github repository

      Visual Studio for Mac checkout Github repository

   .. admonition:: Note

      We use SSH to clone the repo above, but you can use HTTPS if you prefer it.
      If you're not sure which you want to use, that's ok too.

#. Enter the *Target Directory* where you would like to keep your project

   .. admonition:: Tip
   
      Make this a new, empty folder inside of your designated C# practice directory.
