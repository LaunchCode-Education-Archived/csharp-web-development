Windows Users: Visual Studio Community Edition
==============================================

TODO: Check Windows installation steps - and screenshots? do they match any of the next steps section?

#. Download the Community version of Visual Studio IDE from `this page <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/?utm_medium=microsoft&utm_source=docs.microsoft.com&utm_campaign=button+cta&utm_content=download+vs2019>`__.

   .. admonition:: Note

      There are options for other software downloads on this page, Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio for Mac.
      Do not select either of these.

      Allow at least an hour for the installation process.

#. Run the installer, and select the following packages from the *Workloads* pane: 

   - ASP.NET and web development 
   - Azure development 
   - Data storage and processing 
   - .NET core cross-platform development

   Your selections will look like these screens:

#. When the install finishes running, select *Launch* and then close the installer window.

TODO: do we need this step?

#. When prompted, create a Microsoft Developer account and use it to sign in to Visual Studio.

#. The launcher window will prompt you with some choices via a window
   similar to what you see below. Select the displayed options. (If you
   don’t see the box about applying customizations, don’t worry about it,
   just proceed.)

.. admonition:: Note

   If you fail to install one or more of the required packages, you can do
   so by closing Visual Studio and running the installer again. Select
   *Modify* in the Visual Studio section of the window, and then
   select the additional package(s) to install.

.. admonition:: Warning

   If you don’t have this most recent version of Visual Studio
   installed, you will need to install it via the instructions above.

   If you have a pre-existing Visual Studio install, you may need to
   install the .NET Core Tools package. To do so, follow the `instructions
   provided by
   Microsoft <https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#windowsvs2017>`__.
