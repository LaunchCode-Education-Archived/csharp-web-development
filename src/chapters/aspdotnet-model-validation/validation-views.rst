Validation and Views
====================

While our application is properly handing errors, we need to display the error messages so that the users know what information they should be adding.

Displaying Error Messages in our View - Video
---------------------------------------------

.. TODO: Add video here

.. starting branch: handling-errors
.. ending branch: display-error-messages

Displaying Error Messages in our View - Text
--------------------------------------------

Create a separate span element in the form for asp-validation-for to display error messages 

.. admonition:: Note

   We don't have to display any error message, because that validation is already built in!

Now when we run our application and enter a bad event name or forget our description, we get the error message displaying what we should be entering!
