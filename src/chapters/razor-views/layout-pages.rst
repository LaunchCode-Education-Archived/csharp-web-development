The Shared Directory
====================

Earlier in the lesson, we touched upon the role of ``_Layout.cshtml``.
When we set ``Layout`` to ``null``, the header, footer, and Bootstrap disappear from our site and we are left with static HTML.
``_Layout`` is in the ``Shared`` directory of the ``Views`` directory.
Files inside this ``Shared`` directory are used sitewide and can accessed by the templates we create when we are working with our controllers.
These files help us DRY our code.

Layout pages
------------

Whenever we create a new project, we get one layout page, ``_Layout.cshtml``, and this file contains links to Bootstrap.
Layout pages in ASP.NET MVC focus on the header and footer of the site. 
The header and footer of our site when we first create it contains links to important info like a privacy statement.
As you work on your application, you may want your header and footer for each page to include your own privacy statement or a contact page.
When you make updates to ``_Layout``, every template in the application using ``_Layout`` reflects the updates you have made.  

.. index:: ! partial view

Partial Views
-------------

If you want to create repeatable elements of your webpage that are contained within the main body of the page, you can use a **partial view**.
Partial views are blocks of HTML elements that we want to use across multiple templates.

Making a Partial View
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's assume that you want to add the same set of links to multiple pages within your web project.

.. sourcecode:: HTML
   :linenos:

   <a href = "https://www.launchcode.org">LaunchCode</a> <br/>
   <a href = "https://www.lego.com">Play Well</a> <br/>
   <a href = "https://www.webelements.com">Other Building Blocks</a>

Instead of pasting this code into every template, we will store the HTML in
a separate file.

#. Create a new view inside the ``Shared`` folder and give it a clear
   name, such as ``_LinkListPartial.cshtml``.

   .. admonition:: Tip

      If the partial view you are creating is only going to be used for the views for one controller, you can put the partial view in the controller's folder in the ``Views`` directory.

#. Add the code to your file and save!

We can now pull our partial view into any template in our project.

``<partial>``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This tag helper does just what the name implies---it *replaces* the tag that
contains it with the selected partial view. 

Now let's see how to pull a partial view into a template:

.. admonition:: Examples

   .. sourcecode:: HTML
      :linenos:

      <!-- template code -->

      <partial name="/Views/Shared/_LinkListPartial.cshtml" />

      <!-- more template code -->

When the code runs, the ``name`` attribute in the ``<partial>`` tag helper gives the path to the partial view.
In the example above, the partial view is named ``_LinkListPartial.cshtml`` and is in the ``Shared`` folder in the ``Views`` directory.
The code inside the partial view is then rendered as part of the HTML page.

Check Your Understanding
-------------------------

.. admonition:: Question

   Given our code in ``_LinkListPartial.cshtml``, which is stored in the ``Events`` directory:

   .. sourcecode:: HTML
      :linenos:

      <a href = "https://www.launchcode.org">LaunchCode</a> <br/>
      <a href = "https://www.lego.com">Play Well</a> <br/>
      <a href = "https://www.webelements.com">Other Building Blocks</a>

   Which of the following would place the partial view inside a
   ``<div>`` element in the template?

   #. ``<div name="Views/Events/_LinkListPartial.cshtml"></div>``
   #. ``<div><partial>Views/Events/_LinkListPartial</div>``
   #. ``<div><partial name="/Views/Events/_LinkListPartial.cshtml" /></div>``
   #. ``<p><div partial="/Views/Events/_LinkListPartial.cshtml"></div></p>``

.. Answer = c
