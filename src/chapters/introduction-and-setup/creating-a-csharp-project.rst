Creating a C# Project
=====================

Following the "Hello, World" trend, let's create a new Visual Studio project.

#. Create a new folder to hold your C# practice files. Since you will be
   creating lots of small projects as you move through this course, we
   suggest that you also add sub-folders with names corresponding to the
   related chapters and projects. Something like
   ``csharp-practice/chapter-name/project-name``.

#. In Visual Studio, from the project opener window, select the 
   *New* option to create a new Visual Studio project.

#. You next need to choose what project template to use. For this first project,
   select *.NET Core / App / Console Application*.

#. Then, give your new project a name. Following :ref:`naming-conventions`, 
   call your project ``HelloWorld``. The solution name will be the same. Choose 
   where you want this project to be saved, ideally somewhere inside the 
   directory you created in Step 1 of this tutorial. Pick the option to use 
   Git for version control.
