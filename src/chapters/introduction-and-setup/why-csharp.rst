Why Learn C#?
=============

.. index:: ! C#, csharp

This course is an introduction to **C#** and the .NET framework. C# is a
programming language developed by Microsoft and used in almost all of its products. 
This course is designed for learners who are already familiar with at least one
programming language. Thus, we'll move quickly through the syntax rules and
procedural basics of the language (ie, how does one write a ``for`` loop in C#? a 
conditional statement?). 

As you've likely heard before, once you grasp the fundamentals of programming in 
one language, learning another becomes much easier. Professional software 
developers often work in environments involving several programming languages so 
it's wise to start learning new ones early on in your career. 

.. index:: Visual Studio IDE, .NET 

Beyond the basics of programming in C#, you'll learn some key *object oriented*
concepts to enhance the capabilities of your programs. You'll also download a 
program called **Visual Studio IDE** to get familiar with the tools of the C# developer.
In the final lessons of this course, you will use a C# framework called **.NET Core MVC**.
This framework gives us the scaffolding necessary to create *MVC* programs (another
concept we'll cover) effectively and efficiently.
