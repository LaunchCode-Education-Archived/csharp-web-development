Mac Users: Visual Studio for Mac
================================

#. Check that you are using supported MacOS version `here <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/dependencies?pivots=os-macos&tabs=netcore31#supported-operating-systems>`__.

#. Download `Visual Studio for Mac <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/net/>`__. You may be prompted for your 
   computer's password to complete the download and begin installation.

#. The first choice you will need to make in the setup process are the development platforms you want to include in 
   the install with Visual Studio. Select **.NET Core** only.

#. Once installed, the IDE will open on it's own. If it does not, you may need to open it manually. You will next 
   see a window asking you to login to your Microsoft account. You do not need to sign-in in order to use the 
   IDE for this class and can select *I'll do this later* to continue setup.

#. Next you will be asked to choose which shortcut system to use. You may not have a preference yet and can always
   change this later. If you are familiar with the text editor Visual Studio Code, this may be a good starting option
   for you.

#. Finally, you have made it to the project selection window. This will be the item you will see when you open 
   Visual Studio. You do not need to create or open a new project just yet.
