Windows Users: Visual Studio Community Edition
==============================================

#. Download the Community version of Visual Studio IDE from `this page <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/?utm_medium=microsoft&utm_source=docs.microsoft.com&utm_campaign=button+cta&utm_content=download+vs2019>`__.

   .. admonition:: Note

      Users can select from multiple options for software downloads, such as Visual Studio Code and 
      Visual Studio for Mac, on this page. Do NOT select either of these options!

      Allow at least an hour for the installation process.

#. Run the installer, and select the following packages from the *Workloads* pane: 

   - ASP.NET and web development 
   - Azure development 
   - Data storage and processing 
   - .NET core cross-platform development

   Your selections will look like these screens:

#. The launcher window will prompt you with some choices via a window
   similar to what you see below. Select the displayed options. (If you
   don’t see the box about applying customizations, don’t worry about it,
   just proceed.)

.. admonition:: Note

   If you fail to install one or more of the required packages, you can do
   so by closing Visual Studio and running the installer again. Select
   *Modify* in the Visual Studio section of the window, and then
   select the additional package(s) to install.

.. admonition:: Warning

   If you don’t have this most recent version of Visual Studio
   installed, you will need to install it via the instructions above.

   If you have a pre-existing Visual Studio install, you may need to
   install the .NET Core Tools package. To do so, follow the `instructions
   provided by
   Microsoft <https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#windowsvs2017>`__.
