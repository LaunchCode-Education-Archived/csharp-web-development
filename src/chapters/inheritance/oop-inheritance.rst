Inheritance in OOP
==================

.. index:: ! inheritance, ! subtyping

**Inheritance** is the second of the four pillars of object-oriented
programming that we encounter.

allows one class to be based on another class, thus receiving its
properties and behaviors. 

.. note::

   Inheritance is also sometimes referred to as **subtyping**.
