A Tour of Your New IDE

Microsoft has created a `walkthrough <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/quickstart-ide-orientation?view=vs-2022>`_ of the Visual Studio 2022.
We recommend you read through this to learn the location of key components within your new IDE.

These are usually add-ons that you can add or remove from your IDE as you grow in your coding skills.

Connect to GitHub for Windows Users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this course, we will continue to use GitHub and GitHub Classroom for code storage.  
Visual Studio has an extension for making it easier to connect with GitHub.

Troubleshooting Your Install
----------------------------

Missing or Wrong Components?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you realize (or worry) that you did not install Visual Studio correctly, 
the `Modify Visual Studio Guide <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/modify-visual-studio?view=vs-2022>`_ 
can help you make any needed modifications. This includes changing your workloads or individual components.

Already have Visual Studio on Your Computer?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you donâ€™t have this most recent version of Visual Studio installed, you will need to updated it.
The `Update Visual Studio Guide <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/update-visual-studio?view=vs-2022>`_ can help you update your old version of VS to the latest.  
At the time of this writing, the current version for the course is 2022.

Updating can also help you keep any of your workloads, extensions, or other installed packages up to date.
