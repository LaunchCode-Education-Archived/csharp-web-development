Installing Postman
==================

Installing Postman is easy thanks to its cross-platform nature. You can download the installer on `their downloads page <https://www.postman.com/downloads/>`_. 

**Windows Users**: Select the *Windows x64* installer download then run the installer:

After installation, if Postman does not open automatically, locate the download and open it manually. Making an account can be useful, but if you do not 
want to create one, select the link in grey at the bottom of the splash screen to skip this step:

You can leave the launchpad view open for now. We will explore Postman after setting up our API server.
