NuGet
=====

.. index:: ! NuGet

**NuGet** is a package management tool for .NET software. To make use of a dependency framework or library 
in our C# projects without downloading and hosting the dependency ourselves, we can rely on NuGet to 
connect us with third-party code. Just as with MSBuild, we will only scratch the surface of the 
utility of a .NET package manager but it's good to get familiar with these tools. As your programs grow 
larger and rely on more dependencies, both MSBuild and NuGet will be critical tools to maintaining a 
healthy codebase. 

NuGet packages are readily available within the IDE itself. Perhaps you have noticed the *Dependencies* 
directory that is created in our projects? To browse available packages, right click on that directory 
and select "Manage NuGet Packages" from the dropdown menu:

.. figure:: figures/manage-nuget-packages.png
   :scale: 50%
   :alt: User selecting "Manage NuGet Packages" from dependencies dropdown menu

   User selecting "Manage NuGet Packages".

The resulting window shows a catalog of software packages you may add to your project.

Like other dependency managers, NuGet allows you to take advantage of these external code sources without
including the codebase itself. So you can make use of tools and libraries that other developers have already 
built from compiled and bundled code. You can choose to use a specific version of a package hosted by NuGet, 
and update that version as need be.
